> Hugo theme component for ATOM feed custom Output Format.

This component enables ATOM feeds for your site.

## Install Component

The installation method is the same as [installing a theme](https://fixit.lruihao.cn/documentation/installation/). There are several ways to install, choose one, for example, install through Hugo Modules:

```diff
[module]

[[module.imports]]
path = "github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt"

+ [[module.imports]]
+ path = "github.com/hugo-fixit/hugo-atom-feed"
```

## Configuration

Add "atom" to all the Page Kinds for which you want to create ATOM feeds:

```toml
[outputs]
# <baseURL>/atom.xml
home = ["html", "rss", "atom"]
# <baseURL>/posts/atom.xml etc.
section = ["html", "rss", "atom"]
# <baseURL>/tags/foo/atom.xml etc.
term = ["html", "rss", "atom"]
```

If your site uses multiple theme components, you need to merge the `outputs` configuration of all theme components. For example, if your site uses both the `FixIt` and `hugo-atom-feed` theme components, you need to merge the `outputs` configuration of the two theme components:

```toml
[outputs]
_merge = "shallow"
home = ["html", "rss", "atom", "archives", "offline", "readme", "baidu_urls", "search"]
page = ["html", "markdown"]
section = ["html", "rss", "atom"]
taxonomy = ["html"]
term = ["html", "rss", "atom"]
```

### Parameters

You can set the following parameters in your site configuration file:

```toml
[params]

# Global Feed config for ATOM feed.
[params.feed]
# The number of posts to include in the feed. If set to -1, all posts.
limit = 10
# whether to show the full text content in feed.
fullText = true

# Section page config (all pages in section)
[params.section]

# Section feed config for ATOM feed.
[params.section.feed]
# The number of posts to include in the feed. If set to -1, all posts.
limit = -1
# whether to show the full text content in feed.
fullText = false

# Term list (category or tag) page config
[params.list]

# Term list feed config for ATOM feed.
[params.list.feed]
# The number of posts to include in the feed. If set to -1, all posts.
limit = -1
# whether to show the full text content in feed.
fullText = false
```

### Front Matter

```yaml
---

date: 2024-08-24T16:06:33+08:00

  # feed.limit only valid in section or term page(_index.md).
